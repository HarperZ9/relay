"""Falsifiers for the repo map (the code-navigation context feature).

Load-bearing: (1) Python symbols (classes, functions, nested methods) are
extracted with line numbers; (2) noise dirs are ignored; (3) non-Python files are
listed, not parsed; (4) truncation past the file cap is reported, never silent;
(5) an unparseable file degrades to skipped, not a crash.
