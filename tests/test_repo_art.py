"""The front-page artwork, checked rather than eyeballed.

The drawings under docs/art/ are generated from docs/art/relay.art.json. These
tests run the gates in tools/check_repo_art.py and assert on the receipt they
emit, so a spec edited without re-rendering, a card note the wrapper silently
truncates, or an outcome label wider than its box is a red test rather than a
crooked picture nobody looked at.

The clause-ladder card gets a second layer below that. Those gates settle
whether the drawing fits its columns; whether the drawing is TRUE of the
contract module and of the verifier that ships inside a certificate is settled
against those two directly.
