"""local_git.py — optional git integration for the local agent (aider-style).

After an agentic edit run, optionally stage and commit the changes, so every edit
the local model makes is version-controlled and revertible. The commit message
carries the session ledger checkpoint, and — given the ledger's witnessed edit set
— it stages ONLY the files the ledger recorded as write/edit targets, so the
commit binds the witnessed trajectory rather than whatever else the working tree
happens to contain (a dirty file, or a file a shell wrote that the ledger never
recorded as content). It never creates a repo and never pushes; it only commits
inside an existing repo, and only when there are changes.
