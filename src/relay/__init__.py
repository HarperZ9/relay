"""relay — a zero-dep, accountable coding agent that runs on any model endpoint.

Reaches local models (a served 14B/32B, or Ollama) and online providers (codex /
claude / gemini / deepseek, via your own keys, subscription CLI, or a gateway),
fails over across them, and runs a gated agentic loop whose every step is written
to a hash-chained, re-verifiable session ledger. No dependencies; legitimate
credentials only (nothing forged, harvested, or metered around).
