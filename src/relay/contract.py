"""contract.py -- a typed acceptance contract over a witnessed run.

`exit 0` is not acceptance. A contract is a small set of typed clauses, each a
postcondition a third party re-checks over the run's own re-derivable facts: the
hash chain is intact, the acceptance check was not gamed by editing the grader,
the summary claimed no prior work the ledger lacks, no protected file was touched.
Each clause is content-addressed (sha256 over its type + arg), so a contract is a
receipt like everything else here.

`evaluate()` is pure over a facts dict, so the same clause logic runs at emit time
(facts from the run) and at verify time (facts RE-DERIVED from the embedded
ledger). The two must agree for an untampered certificate. A clause returns True
(held), False (refuted), or None (unverifiable -- the fact could not be checked);
the verdict is REFUTED on any False, else UNVERIFIABLE on any None, else ALLOW.
