"""async_runs.py — start a gated agent run in the background, poll its progress.

A blocking HTTP POST that runs a multi-step agent is fine on localhost but drops
on a mobile network long before a real coding run finishes, and a phone MCP
connector times the call out. This registry starts the work in a background
thread against a fresh witnessed ledger and hands back a run_id at once. A phone
then polls status (steps so far + the latest witnessed ledger entries) and
fetches the result (the verified checkpoint) when the run is done -- each poll a
short request that survives a dropped connection.

Determinism is by injection (clock + id source), so the registry is testable
without wall-clock time or real randomness. The registry is bounded and evicts
the oldest run records; a still-running loop is bounded by its own max_steps.
