"""remote_state.py -- whether a phone could reach this workstation, and on what terms.

The remote MCP surface runs as its own process (``python -m relay.remote_mcp``),
so nothing talking to the local stdio server can tell whether it is configured at
all. A client that offers "remote access" and cannot say this is guessing.

This reads the same two sources ``remote_cli`` composes, the env file and the
real environment, and reports without handing back a secret: a value comes back
only for the keys on VALUE_SAFE, and every other key the surface reads is
reported as a boolean.

The half-configured case is the one worth naming. ``_oauth_from_env`` returns
None unless all six of its keys are set, and the server then serves the static
bearer with no phone connector and says nothing about why. Here that reads as
oauth off with the missing keys named.
