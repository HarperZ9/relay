"""mcp_paths.py -- files inside a run's root that belong to the server, not the run.

The launch root confines an MCP run's file tools, and the server's own files can
sit inside it (the remote launch scripts start in the directory holding .env).
So an MCP run's file tools also refuse:

- the env file the remote entrypoint reads (RELAY_ENV_FILE, default ``.env``),
  for reads and writes: it holds the bearer token and the OAuth secrets;
- writes into the run store (RELAY_RUN_ROOT) and the session store
  (RELAY_SESSION_DIR), whose records a run could otherwise forge;
- writes into any ``.git`` directory, where a hook or a config line runs code
  the next time git runs in that tree.

On Windows a name that ends in a dot or a space, or that names a stream
(``a:b``), opens another spelling of a file, so a write to one is refused.

The limit: this covers the file tools only. With exec granted, a shell reaches
all of these, and a write elsewhere in the tree can still run later as code.
