"""mcp_grants.py -- write, exec and root grants for the MCP servers, set at launch.

The process that starts a relay MCP server decides whether its runs may write
or execute, with ``--allow-write`` / ``--allow-exec`` or ``RELAY_ALLOW_WRITE`` /
``RELAY_ALLOW_EXEC``. Both are off by default. It also pins the launch root,
with ``--root`` or ``RELAY_MCP_ROOT``, defaulting to the working directory.

One run gets what it asks for and the launch granted, both. A run that omits
``allow_write`` / ``allow_exec`` asks for neither, as in 0.2.5, and ``true``
asks for no more than the launch granted. Its ``root`` argument must resolve
inside the launch root.

Two couplings follow from what a shell can do. Exec implies write, because a
shell can write files, so ``allow_exec: true`` also asks for write. Narrowing
write with ``allow_write: false`` turns exec off, for the same reason. The online
codex and claude CLI tiers start an agent with its own shell, so they count as
exec.

The honest limit: the file tools are confined to the run's root, and the shell
is not. ``run``, ``test_cmd`` and ``check`` start in root and can reach any path
the server's user can. Write is also a route to code execution: a file written
into the tree runs the next time something executes it there (a git hook, a
build script, a shell profile under a home-directory root).
