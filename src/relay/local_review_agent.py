"""local_review_agent.py -- an independent, fresh-context reviewer.

A run's own review.py projection is derived from the SAME trajectory the author
produced, so it shares the author's blind spots. This adds a second opinion: a
fresh agent that sees ONLY the task and the diff, never the author's ledger,
receipts, or reasoning, and returns an independent APPROVE / REQUEST_CHANGES
verdict with findings. A reviewer without the author's context finds what the
author, and a projection of the author's own run, cannot.

The reviewer is one model call, so it is injected (a make_agent factory) and fully
testable without a backend. Honest null: the reviewer is itself a model and can be
wrong; its verdict is a second signal, never an oracle, and it never gates the run
(the witnessed accept gate does that). It reviews the recorded edit set, so a file
changed by a shell redirection outside the witnessed tools is not in its view.
